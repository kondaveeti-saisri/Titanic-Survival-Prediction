# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction  

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a passenger survived the **Titanic disaster** based on their features like age, gender, class, etc.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or other sources)  
- **Goal**: Predict passenger survival using Machine Learning  
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠 Steps Involved  

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables  
2. **Model Training**: Training a Logistic Regression model  
3. **Model Evaluation**: Checking accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
4. **Saving & Loading Model**: Exporting the trained model for future use  
5. **Making Predictions**: Testing with sample passenger data

## 📈 Results  

✅ Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset (sample case).  
✅ Successfully classified passengers as **"Survived"** or **"Not Survived"**.
