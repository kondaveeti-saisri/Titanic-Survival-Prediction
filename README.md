🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their features like age, gender, class, etc.

📌 Project Overview
-> Dataset: Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or other sources)
-> Goal: Predict passenger survival using Machine Learning
-> Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
-> Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook

📂 Project Structure
-> titanic_dataset.csv → Titanic dataset used for training
-> titanic_model.pkl → Saved trained model
-> titanic_prediction.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with full implementation

🛠 Steps Involved
1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
2.Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression model
3.Model Evaluation: Checking accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
4.Saving & Loading Model: Exporting the trained model for future use
5.Making Predictions: Testing with sample passenger data

📈 Results
-> Achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset (sample case).
-> Successfully classified passengers as "Survived" or "Not Survived".
